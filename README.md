# MyReads Appliction

This is a React Appliction that is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
The Application Works like a library where you have 3 shelves and You can switch books from shelve to another, also you can
add new books to any shelf from the search page


## Installation

To get started working with the application :

* run `git clone https://github.com/mohamed00Sayed/reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
